      <h3>Registration and Payment</h3>
      <p>In order to take part in the convention, you are required to buy a ticket emitted through the Flüüfff
        registration. Tickets purchased from other sources are not valid.</p>

      <h4>Payment by bank transfer</h4>
      <p>The first payment for an invoice is due within 10 calendar days after you have selected the payment by bank
        transfer.
        If we do not receive proof of payment within 10 days after the payment method has been selected, your slot is no

        For payments of more than 120€, we also permit payment in maximum 3 instalments up to 2 month before the

        <li>First instalment has to be paid within 10 days.</li>
        <li>All instalments have to be paid within 2 months or at the latest 1 month before the convention, whichever
          comes first.</li>
        <li>If the payment is not completed by this date the booking will be cancelled without any refund.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Payment via Stripe (Bancontact, credit and debit card)</h4>

        new room price is lower than what the attendees paid, the difference will be refunded.</p>
      <h4>Registration</h4>
      <p>Non-staff attendees registering before the official registration date, may get banned from the convention. In
        that case, the registration team reserves the right to refund your registration costs.</p>
      <h4>Delivery</h4>
      <p>A confirmation email will be sent to you when everything has been paid fully.
        You can always access your account page to print out your confirmation, check the payment status for your
        invoices or print your invoices.</p>
      <h3>Age Verification</h3>

      <h3>Cancellation/Ticket Transfer</h3>

        up at the convention who is not in our database will not be admitted in someone else’s name.</p>

        exception of processing fees and organisation costs.
        Any and all other expenses, such as travel costs or other expenses not with Flüüfff, will not be refunded under
        any circumstances.</p>

        package.</p>
      <h3>Terms of Conduct</h3>

        Flüüfff likes to present itself as a professional convention of friendly, respectful, and open-minded members of
        the furry community and their friends. To avoid any misunderstanding about what kind of behaviour is generally
        acceptable at an event like Flüüfff, you are expected to follow these rules. Please make sure that you read and
        understand them. Also keep in mind that these rules are in effect during the whole convention time, including

          </ul>

      <h4>Clothing and Decency</h4>
      <p>Flüüfff wants to be as tolerant and welcoming as possible towards all attendees. This means we wish to be as

        public spaces. Exceptions to the rules below will be clearly communicated as well as the specific hours and
        areas to which they apply.
        Be aware that some items of clothing, apparel, or similar items might bring the convention and/or fandom into
        disrepute and should not be worn in public. If you have to ask or think twice about doing something in public,
        it is a good indication that you should take it to your room.

        registration.</p>

      <h2>Flüüfff&#x27;s Dealers Den Policies</h2>
      <p>All Policies are subject to change without notice. By applying for space in the Flüüfff Dealers Den, you agree
        you have read and understand these policies.</p>
      <h3>Registering for the Dealers Den</h3>
      <p>Our registration is not a First Come, First Serve kind of deal;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 weeks after initial registration we will start making the first sketch for the room; 18th of June 2022
        </li>
        <li>The applications after this process will be sorted in, when possible.</li>
        <li>We strife to send out the first room sketch out the</li>
        <li>When the room is full, the dealer will receive an email notification of being on the Waiting list.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note, we are volunteers; we strive to complete this phase and communicate it to every Dealer if they are
        chosen, but this might be delayed.</p>
      <p>Our tables are Free; This means it is a free service from the convention towards you, our Dealers, just as it
        is a service to our attendees.</p>
      <p>The registration for a table is done in the initial registration process for becoming an attendee for this
        edition. This means: You will need to have a valid convention ticket, and thus paid in full, by the time we will
        make the room sketch.</p>
      <h4>Approval</h4>
      <p>Once you have been approved you will be sent an email notifying you.
        If you were approved, and your table wasn’t claimed within 2 weeks, you can email the Dealers Den team
        (dealers.den@fluufff.org) and request to be placed on the waiting list; you are not directly eligible for a new
        table.</p>
      <p>If you are placed on the waiting list, you will be added to the bottom of the list. If we reach you again, you
        will have 2 weeks to accept this one via a reply. If you fail to claim that table - you will not be added to the
        waiting list for that year/edition/convention again.</p>
      <h3>What we look for in our Dealers:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality</strong>: We want to offer the best to our attendees, so this is important for us.</li>
        <li><strong>Variety</strong>: We want to offer a large selection of products made for and within the furry
          community.</li>
        <li><strong>Quantity</strong>: The weekend has an attendee rate of about 300 guests right now. We strive for a
          Dealers Den that has a full look.</li>
        <li><strong>Belgian</strong>: We are a Belgian convention, and we want to try to have a certain % of local
          vendors every year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Prior experience as a dealer is not necessary.</p>
      <h2>General Information</h2>

      <h4>Convention Ticket</h4>
      <p>Dealer tables do not come with Convention Tickets. All dealers and their assistants must have purchased a
        ticket before they can enter the Dealer’s Den. Dealers and assistants will have a marking on or attached to
        their badge to show they may enter the room during Dealer set-up/closing time. All assistants must be connected
        to a dealer, and there is a limit of 1 assistant per Dealer.</p>
      <h4>Dealer Room</h4>
      <p>The Dealers Den will be secured when not open. The room will be locked and checked regularly.
        Do not, under any circumstances, leave cash or other valuables inside of the Dealers Den that you may need after
        the den closes. This includes Laptops, MP3 players, or medication. This room will not be opened before the next
        slot without a good cause.</p>
      <h4>Table Sharing</h4>
      <p>Tables may be split between 2 individual dealers. However, the second dealer must go through the registration
        process just as the first dealer. Once approved, when the deadline hasnt passed yet, their information will be
        added to the conbook.
        Each dealer will need to apply, and can request to be seated next to another dealer. Please see ‘Requests’ for
        more information.</p>
      <h4>Internet</h4>
      <p>We will not provide a special internet access for our Dealers. You are able to use your own cellular or the
        open guest Wifi of the hotel.</p>
      <h4>Requests</h4>
      <p>Flüüfff&#x27;s will make every attempt to satisfy any and all special requests, but we can’t guarantee
        anything. If you have a special request, you are urged to contact us as soon as possible. Requests for
        electricity and wall space will be fulfilled first.
        Other requests, such as to sit next to a specific dealer, will be the last to be fulfilled, these requests also
        need to be submitted by both dealers; So both Dealer A and B have to inform us that they prefer to sit next to
        each other.</p>
      <h3>Display Guidelines &amp; Behavior</h3>
      <p>Please remember that not everyone may share your tastes, and that your behavior is representative of the entire
        fandom, just as the event itself.</p>
      <h4>Not Safe for Work (NSFW)</h4>
      <p>Definition: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work .</p>
      <p>We ask you kindly to put any work that is considered NSFW in a folder and thus not display this openly; for
        example, art/print dealers we request, where applicable, that two separate binders (‘Clean’, ‘NSFW’) be kept.
        If you are unsure if your piece of merchandise is NSFW, please contact the Dealers Den team on site, or prior
        via email.</p>
      <p>Art or any other depiction of Zoophilia, and Pedophila, Religion, Racism or otherwise will be asked to be put
        away. Items made from real fur or body parts (taxidermy, skulls) are also forbidden to be sold.</p>
      <h4>Behavior rules</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No space may be transferred without permission from the Dealers Den head.</li>
        <li>No loud displays will be permitted. We will provide some nice music in the room.</li>
        <li>No pirated works may be sold in the Dealers Den. Piracy is theft.</li>
        <li>When selling items or art made by another artist than you as dealer, we ask you to clearly mark items with
          the info of said artist. We may also ask you for the official paperwork that states that you own the
          copyrights of these art pieces.</li>
        <li>Free standing displays or stands may not be used in any way that can cause a safety issue or clogs the
          walkway. If you plan on using anything Outside of your tablespace, please inform the Dealers Den staff so we
          can plan this into our table set up.</li>
        <li>No weapons may be sold in the Dealers Den. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis, but will need to
          be cleared through security.</li>
        <li>No more than 2 people may be behind a single table at any given time.</li>
        <li>Please keep your area clean and take your trash with you, or dispose of it in any of the trash cans
          provided, when you close up each night.</li>
        <li>Have common decency and respect; don’t steal another Dealer’s customers, and protect one another&#x27;s
          goods from theft.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Dealers Den Head of Department and their Deputy will have a final say on all disputes in the Den. You can
        appeal to the Director, but they are likely to decide in favor of the Head. All Flüüfff&#x27;s Policies apply in
        the Dealers Den.</p>
      <h4>Waiting List</h4>
      <p>The Dealers Den waiting list will consist of all the pre-approved dealers selected from initial applications.
        The applications will be closed 4 weeks prior to the convention. Please apply during this period to be
        considered for the waiting list. In the event of a cancellation, the first person on the list will be contacted
        to fill the space, and so forth.</p>
      <p><strong>In any case</strong>, be it with first choice Dealers, or people from the waiting list: you will need
        to accept this table within 4 days with a reply on the email where we inform you. If this reaction isn&#x27;t
        received in time, the dealer will be put to the bottom of the waiting list. In the event they miss the second
        opening of a table, they will be removed completely.</p>
      <h4>Cancelation</h4>
      <p>Please let us know as soon as possible, if you end up unable to attend the convention. This way we are able to
        get in contact with dealers from our waiting list quickly, so they can use that time to prepare and plan.</p>
      <p>Dealers Den tables are not transferable to other dealers at the request of the canceling dealer.
        Flüüfff is not responsible for upholding promised transfers that violate these Terms of Service.
        Please do this via an email. Cancelation via Telegram won’t be accepted as an official means of notification.
